# python_FPS

the FPS_CONSOLE.py file is a console application that use the win32console class from the pywin32 library to interact with the console api
of windows os but it runs slow, but i thought why not to add it.

the FPS_graphics file in the ather hand is a PyQt5 graphic application it will have the same logic and algorithms from the FPS_CONSOLE.py
file but in a graphical way.
